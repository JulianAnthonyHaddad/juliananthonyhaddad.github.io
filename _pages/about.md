I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Davis, where I study the political economy of the welfare state, automation, and public opinion. My research investigates how technological change—particularly the rise of artificial intelligence—shapes preferences for redistribution, regulation, and populism.

My dissertation explores when and why individuals respond to automation threats with support for different kinds of economic policies, and how those responses are conditioned by their expected future economic position, knowledge of AI, and broader institutional contexts. I use experimental, survey, and cross-national data to examine how the welfare state mediates political reactions to technological disruption.

Beyond my dissertation, I’m interested in the global politics of welfare reform, support for left- and right-populist parties, and how economic shocks interact with institutional design to shape democratic outcomes.

I am also an experienced instructor with a strong record of teaching and mentorship. I’ve taught a variety of undergraduate courses—both online and in person—on American politics, comparative politics, media, and political theory, with a focus on inclusive pedagogy and active learning.

Outside of academia, I enjoy baking sourdough bread, playing guitar, and creating comics.
