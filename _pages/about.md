I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Davis, where I study the political economy of the welfare state, automation, and public opinion. I am particularly interested in how different countries' intellectual traditions inform modern policy debates over the welfare state.

My dissertation explores when and why individuals respond to economic threats with support for different kinds of economic policies, and how those responses are conditioned by the generosity of their country's welfare state. I use experimental, survey, and cross-national data to examine how the welfare state mediates political reactions to technological disruption.

I am an experienced instructor with a strong record of teaching, mentorship, and engagement with pedagocial research as a Teaching Assistant Consultant at UC Davis's Center for Educational Effectiveness. Since 2017, when I firsst began teaching world history & political philosophy at UC San Diego while obtaining my Master's of International Affairs degree, Iâ€™ve taught a variety of undergraduate courses American politics, comparative politics, media, and political theory, with a focus on inclusive pedagogy and active learning.

Outside of academia, I enjoy baking sourdough bread, playing guitar, and creating comics.
